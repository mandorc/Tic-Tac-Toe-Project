# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This project is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. It allows users to play against each other or against the system, which uses the Minimax algorithm to make decisions.

## Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategy game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking boxes on a 3x3 board. The goal is to get three of your symbols to line up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Minimax algorithm
The game system against the computer uses the Minimax algorithm to make decisions. Minimax is a game tree search algorithm that finds the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent also plays optimally. It recursively explores all possible future plays to determine the best possible action, minimizing the maximum loss ("min") or maximizing the minimum profit ("max").

## Development

This project was developed using NetBeans, a very useful integrated development environment (IDE) for Java applications. The code is written in Java and follows standard programming conventions to ensure readability and maintainability.

## How to run the game

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in NetBeans.
3. Compile the code if necessary.
4. Run the main class.
